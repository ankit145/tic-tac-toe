# tic-tac-toe
I implemented it in C++ language
Tic-tac-toe is a simple, two-player game that, if played optimally by both players, will always result in a tie. The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os.
Later on I will do some changes by using headerfiles of C++ so that a single Player can play with computer.
